HOW TO RECOGNIZE THIS WISDOM (7):  WITHOUT HYPOCRISY 

But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
James 3:17 (KJV)

This is the last characteristic of divine Wisdom that Brother James talked about.  This Wisdom is without hypocrisy.  In Greek, the words for hypocrisy and hypocrite have to do with someone playing a part, as if they were an actor on stage. They’re dissemblers, pretenders who simulate, feign, and pretend to be something they are not (Thayer’s dictionary, entries on G5273 and G5271). The opposite is what we find in wisdom — anupokritos (G505), something that is unfeigned, undisguised, sincere.  Somehow, we’re all familiar with the problem of hypocrisy in the Church. For most of us, it’s something we’ve had close experience with. We’ve found ourselves disgusted with others who we identify as hypocrites and we may even have caught ourselves doing hypocritical things.  The Bible tells us “wisdom is the principle thing, therefore get wisdom” (Prov. 4:7, KJV).  Wisdom is something Yahweh has in abundance and which He is eager to share with those who ask for it (James 1:5). As we grow in wisdom we will become people who are sincere, authentic, and live without hypocrisy.

Avoiding hypocrisy is not as simple a matter as it may seem, even for mature Christians. For example, Paul speaks of a time when the Apostle Peter and “even Barnabas” were carried away by hypocrisy, along with other Jewish Christians (Gal. 2:11-14). We all need to be vigilant.  James 5:12 (WEB) says, “But above all things, my brothers, don’t swear— not by heaven, or by the earth, or by any other oath; but let your “yes” be “yes”, and your “no”, “no”, so that you don’t fall into hypocrisy.”  You’ve probably read translations of this verse where the last line reads “lest you fall under judgement,” but the Greek word here is hupokrisis (G5272). I think knowing James is talking about hypocrisy makes his “above all things” statement make more sense. There is a great need for us to live genuine, godly lives without dissembling, lying, double-standards, and pay-acting.

The word used in James for “without hypocrisy” is used only five other times. In addition to wisdom being without hypocrisy, we’re also to love without hypocrisy (Rom. 12:9; 2 Cor. 6:6; 1 Pet. 1:22) and have faith without hypocrisy (1 Tim. 1:5; 2 Tim. 1:5). Sincere, unfeigned faith and love are core parts of a Christian life. As one of Yahweh’s most important character traits, love is foundational to having Godly wisdom. Faith and wisdom are also linked (Matt. 24:45; 2 Tim. 3:15).  I Peter 2:1-3 says, “1 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,  2 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:  3 If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.”  We have all tasted the Lord’s grace and love if we’re in a relationship with Him. As such, we owe Him our whole hearts — not some outward, play-acted version of insincere faith.

REMEMBER:   The Wisdom from above is without hypocrisy.

CONFESSION:   I am a sincere, truthful, and dedicated friend.  When I say that I love, I genuinely love.  I don’t talk behind people’s backs.  I don’t gossip.  I don’t betray the friends Adonai has brought into my life.  I function by Divine Wisdom.  Halleluyah!!!

PROPHETIC RELEASE:   I release grace upon you now to be true to Yahweh, brethren and yourself and whatever is confronting you today as a challenge turns to testimony for you now in the name of Yahushua HaMashiach Amen!
